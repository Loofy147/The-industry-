## Gap Report: Data Parsing and Serialization Industry

### Introduction

The data parsing and serialization industry is fundamental to modern software, with CSV (Comma-Separated Values) being one of the most common data interchange formats. Despite its ubiquity, a deep and critical gap exists in the implementation of many CSV parsers, leading to significant data integrity issues.

### The Gap: Incorrect Handling of Delimiters and Newlines in Quoted Fields

A common failure in many CSV parsers is the incorrect handling of delimiters (e.g., commas) and newline characters that appear within double-quoted fields. According to the RFC 4180 standard, any field containing a delimiter or a newline must be enclosed in double quotes. A robust parser must be able to differentiate between a delimiter that separates fields and one that is part of the data within a quoted field.

Many naive implementations simply split lines by newlines and then split the resulting lines by commas. This approach completely fails when a field contains a newline or a comma, leading to silent data corruption.

### Impact

This gap has severe consequences, especially in data-driven fields like data science, machine learning, and business intelligence. When a CSV parser fails to handle these cases correctly, it can lead to:
*   **Data Corruption**: Rows are incorrectly split, shifting data into the wrong columns.
*   **Data Loss**: Records can be truncated or merged incorrectly.
*   **Application Failures**: Downstream systems that rely on the parsed data will fail or produce incorrect results.
This is not a minor bug; it's a fundamental flaw that undermines the reliability of data processing pipelines.

### Proposed Fix

I will implement a robust, state-machine-based CSV parser in JavaScript that correctly adheres to the RFC 4180 specification. The parser will iterate through the CSV string character by character, maintaining its state (e.g., whether it is currently inside a quoted field). This allows it to correctly handle delimiters and newlines within quoted fields.

### Implementation Strategy

1.  **Develop a `parseCsv` function** that takes a CSV string as input.
2.  **Implement a state machine** that tracks whether the parser is inside a quoted field.
3.  **Handle delimiters and newlines** correctly based on the current state.
4.  **Support escaped quotes** (i.e., `""` inside a quoted field) as per the RFC 4180 standard.
5.  **Write a comprehensive test suite** with complex CSV strings that include quoted fields with delimiters, newlines, and escaped quotes to prove the parser's correctness.

This solution will provide a reliable and accurate CSV parsing utility that can be trusted in mission-critical data processing applications.
