## Gap Report: Online Data Validation Services Industry

### Introduction

The online data validation services industry is critical for ensuring data accuracy in web applications. However, a significant gap exists in the client-side validation of International Bank Account Numbers (IBANs), leading to high error rates and a poor user experience.

### The Gap: Lack of Comprehensive Client-Side IBAN Validation

Many online forms and financial applications fail to perform robust, client-side validation of IBANs. This is often due to the complexity of the IBAN format, which includes country-specific lengths and a checksum validation that is computationally intensive to perform on the client-side. As a result, users often submit incorrect IBANs, which are only caught by server-side validation, leading to a frustrating user experience.

### Impact

The lack of client-side IBAN validation results in a higher rate of transactional errors, increased customer support costs, and a general lack of trust in the application. It also creates a slower, less responsive user experience, as users must wait for a server response to know if their IBAN is valid.

### Proposed Fix

I will implement a comprehensive, client-side IBAN validation function in JavaScript. This function will perform the following checks:
1.  **Format Validation**: Ensures the IBAN consists of a two-letter country code followed by alphanumeric characters.
2.  **Length Validation**: Checks that the IBAN has the correct length for the specified country.
3.  **Checksum Validation**: Implements the ISO 7064 mod-97 algorithm to verify the IBAN's integrity.

### Implementation Strategy

1.  **Develop a `validateIban` function** that takes an IBAN string as input.
2.  **Implement the validation logic** as described above, including a country-specific length map.
3.  **Write a comprehensive test suite** with a wide range of valid and invalid IBANs from various countries to ensure the function is accurate and reliable.

This solution will provide immediate feedback to users, reduce errors, and improve the overall user experience of any application that requires IBAN validation.
