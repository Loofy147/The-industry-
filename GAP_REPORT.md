## Gap Report: Scientific Calculator Industry

### Introduction

The scientific calculator industry provides essential tools for students, engineers, and scientists. While basic arithmetic operations are well-established, a significant gap exists in the handling of advanced mathematical functions, particularly concerning precision and edge cases.

### The Gap: Insufficient Handling of Factorials for Non-Integer Inputs

Many scientific calculators restrict the factorial function (`n!`) to non-negative integers. This limitation ignores the gamma function, which extends the factorial to all complex numbers except for non-positive integers. This oversight means that users cannot compute factorials for non-integer values, which is a critical function in advanced mathematics and engineering fields such as statistics and physics.

### Impact

This gap forces users to rely on more complex software or external tools to perform these calculations, disrupting their workflow and reducing the utility of the calculator. It also reflects a failure to meet the evolving needs of advanced users who require more sophisticated mathematical capabilities.

### Proposed Fix

To address this, I will implement a factorial function that correctly handles non-integer inputs by using the Lanczos approximation of the gamma function. This will allow the calculator to provide accurate results for a wider range of inputs, including real and complex numbers.

### Implementation Strategy

1. **Develop a `factorial` function** that checks if the input is a non-negative integer. If it is, the function will compute the factorial using a standard iterative approach.
2. **For non-integer inputs**, the function will use the Lanczos approximation to calculate the gamma function (`Î“(n + 1)`), which is equivalent to `n!`.
3. **Write a comprehensive test suite** to verify the function's accuracy for both integer and non-integer inputs, including edge cases like negative numbers and zero.

This approach will fill a critical gap in the scientific calculator market, making our tool more versatile and powerful for advanced users.
