# Gap Report: CQRS and Event Sourcing

## 1. The Gap: The Limits of a Single, State-Based Data Model

The conventional approach to data management, where a single model is used for both writing and reading data (often referred to as CRUD), presents a significant architectural gap in modern, scalable, and data-intensive applications. This model, which stores only the latest state of an entity, is fundamentally limited.

This single-model approach creates a cascade of deeper industry-wide problems:
- **The Read/Write Contention Gap:** In any high-throughput system, the patterns for writing data (optimized for consistency and validation) are fundamentally different from the patterns for reading data (optimized for speed and diverse querying). Forcing a single data model to serve both purposes creates performance contention and leads to complex, inefficient designs.
- **The State History Gap:** By only storing the current state, traditional databases engage in "destructive updates." The history of *how* an entity reached its current state is lost forever. This is a critical failure for auditing, debugging complex bugs, and understanding business trends over time.
- **The Temporal Query Gap:** A direct consequence of the state history gap is the inability to perform temporal queries. It's impossible to answer business-critical questions like, "What did this customer's shopping cart look like 10 minutes before they checked out?" or "How many users were 'premium' subscribers last month?"

## 2. The Flaw: Conflating Data's Past and Present

The root flaw is treating data as if only its present state matters. The system fails to recognize that the sequence of events leading to the current state is often more valuable than the state itself. This conflation of the write model (the "command" to change state) and the read model (the "query" for the current state) is an architectural compromise that inhibits scalability and insight.

## 3. The Fix: Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) and Event Sourcing (ES)

The most advanced solution to this gap is a combination of two powerful architectural patterns:

**1. Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS):** This principle mandates a strict separation between the model used to update data (the Command model) and the model used to read data (the Query model).
    - **Commands** are task-based, intent-revealing objects (e.g., `DeactivateUser`, `AddItemToCart`). They are handled by a "write side" optimized for validation and consistency.
    - **Queries** are handled by a "read side" that uses denormalized, pre-computed data models tailored specifically for the application's display needs, ensuring maximum performance.

**2. Event Sourcing (ES):** Instead of storing the current state, we store the full, immutable history of all changes as a sequence of "domain events." The current state of an entity is derived by replaying these events.
    - An **Event** is a factual, past-tense record of a business event (e.g., `UserDeactivated`, `ItemAddedToCart`).
    - The **Event Store** becomes the primary source of truth, providing a perfect audit log of everything that has ever happened in the system.

By combining CQRS and Event Sourcing, we create a system that is not only highly performant and scalable but also provides complete data lineage, enabling powerful analytics and deep system insights that are impossible to achieve with traditional models. This is the architectural foundation for resilient, auditable, and intelligent modern applications.
