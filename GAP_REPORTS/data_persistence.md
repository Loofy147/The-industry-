# Gap Report: Data Persistence and Querying

## 1. Executive Summary

The system currently relies on in-memory data structures for all storage needs. This approach is not suitable for a production environment due to the following limitations:

- **Data Loss**: All data is lost when the application restarts.
- **Scalability**: In-memory storage does not scale beyond the limits of a single machine.
- **Querying**: The lack of a dedicated query language makes it difficult to retrieve data efficiently.

This report recommends the implementation of a file-based persistence mechanism as a foundational step toward a more robust and scalable data storage solution.

## 2. Analysis of the Gap

The absence of a durable storage layer introduces significant risks and limitations. A file-based database will provide a simple, effective, and dependency-free solution that can be extended in the future.

## 3. High-Level Solution

The proposed solution involves the following steps:

1. **Implement a File-Based Database**: Create a new module that serializes data to disk.
2. **Integrate with the Event Store**: Refactor the `EventStore` to use the new persistence layer.
3. **Add a New Test Case**: Introduce a test to verify that data is persisted correctly.
