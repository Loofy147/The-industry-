# Gap Report: Distributed Workflow and Data Consistency

## 1. The Gap: The Challenge of Atomic Operations in Distributed Systems

As software architecture evolves from monolithic to microservices-based, a critical gap emerges: the inability to reliably perform atomic operations that span multiple, independent services. In a monolith, a single database transaction can guarantee that a series of actions either all succeed or all fail. In a distributed system, where each service has its own database and state, this guarantee is lost.

This leads to a cascade of problems:
- **Data Inconsistency:** If a multi-step process fails midway, the system is left in an inconsistent state, with some services having completed their part of the operation and others not. This corrupts data and leads to severe bugs.
- **Brittle Coordination Logic:** Developers are forced to write complex, error-prone boilerplate code to orchestrate these workflows. This logic, often involving custom retry mechanisms and manual rollbacks, is hard to test, maintain, and reason about.
- **Poor Observability:** When a distributed workflow fails, it is incredibly difficult to trace the sequence of events across multiple services to identify the point of failure and its root cause.

## 2. The Flaw: Absence of a Formal Distributed Transaction Pattern

The root flaw is the lack of a formal, high-level architectural pattern for managing long-running, multi-service operations. The existing codebase, while demonstrating decoupling, still relies on direct, synchronous calls between services (e.g., `UserLogic` directly calling `UserRepository` and `EmailService`). This approach is fragile and does not scale.

## 3. The Fix: The Saga Orchestrator Pattern

The most advanced and robust solution to this gap is the **Saga pattern**, a design pattern for managing data consistency in distributed systems. A saga is a sequence of local transactions. Each transaction updates the database within a single service and publishes an event or message to trigger the next transaction in the saga. If a transaction fails, the saga executes a series of compensating transactions that undo the changes made by the preceding successful transactions.

I will implement a centralized **Saga Orchestrator**, which provides a powerful and generic way to:
- **Define Workflows:** Clearly define the steps and compensating actions of any given saga in a single, easy-to-understand location.
- **Execute and Coordinate:** The orchestrator reliably executes each step in sequence, passing data between them.
- **Ensure Consistency:** If any step fails, the orchestrator automatically invokes the corresponding compensating actions in reverse order, guaranteeing that the system returns to a consistent state.
- **Provide Observability:** The orchestrator can log the state of each saga, providing a clear audit trail for debugging and monitoring.

By implementing a generic `SagaOrchestrator`, we are not just fixing a single issue but are providing a foundational, architectural building block that can be used to solve any number of distributed transaction problems across the industry.
