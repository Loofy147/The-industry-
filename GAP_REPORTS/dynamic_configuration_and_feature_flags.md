# Gap Report: Dynamic Configuration and Feature Flags

## 1. Executive Summary

The current system architecture relies on a static configuration model where all settings are loaded from environment variables at startup. This common industry practice, while simple, introduces significant operational friction and risk. Any change, from toggling a feature to adjusting a logging level, requires a full application redeployment, leading to downtime and "big bang" releases.

This report identifies a "multi-gap" encompassing operational inflexibility, a lack of real-time control, and the inability to perform gradual rollouts (e.g., canary or A/B testing). The proposed solution is to implement a **Dynamic Configuration and Feature Flag System**. This will provide a centralized, real-time mechanism to manage application behavior without requiring restarts, thereby improving system resilience, enabling safer deployments, and increasing operational agility.

## 2. Analysis of the Gap

The static configuration model creates several interconnected problems:

-   **Operational Inflexibility:** Simple tuning of parameters (e.g., circuit breaker timeouts, logging verbosity) becomes a slow and risky process involving code changes, CI/CD pipelines, and deployments.
-   **High-Risk Deployments:** New features must be released to all users at once. It is impossible to conduct canary releases (releasing to a small subset of users) or A/B tests to validate a feature's performance and business impact before a full rollout.
-   **Inadequate Incident Response:** During a production incident, the inability to disable a faulty feature or adjust system parameters in real-time hinders rapid mitigation. For example, a buggy feature causing database overload cannot be turned off without an emergency hotfix and redeployment.

This cluster of issues can be solved with a single, abstract solution that externalizes configuration into a dynamic, remotely-updatable service.

## 3. High-Level Solution

The proposed solution is to build a simulated dynamic configuration system, which includes a central config service and a feature flag manager.

1.  **Implement a `ConfigService`:** A new module, `src/config_service.js`, will act as a simulated, centralized configuration store. It will hold the current configuration state and, crucially, allow for updating values at runtime. It will use a simple pub/sub model to notify subscribed services of any changes. In a real-world scenario, this would be backed by a service like AWS AppConfig, LaunchDarkly, or a simple Redis store.

2.  **Implement a `FeatureFlagManager`:** Built on top of the `ConfigService`, `src/feature_flag_manager.js` will provide a clean, high-level API for feature flagging (e.g., `featureFlagManager.isEnabled('new-checkout-flow')`). This decouples business logic from the underlying configuration structure.

3.  **Refactor a Service for Dynamic Behavior:** `src/configurable_service.js` will be refactored. Instead of loading its configuration once, it will subscribe to the `ConfigService`. Its behavior will then change dynamically in response to real-time configuration updates.

4.  **Verification through Testing:** A new test suite, `tests/dynamic_config.test.js`, will be created. It will verify the core requirement: that a service's behavior can be changed at runtime by updating the `ConfigService`, *without* restarting the service instance. This will prove the gap has been successfully filled.
