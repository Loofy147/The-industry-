# Gap Report: System Resilience and the Circuit Breaker Pattern

## 1. Executive Summary

In a distributed system, services often depend on other services to fulfill requests. This interconnectedness creates a significant risk: a failure or slowdown in one downstream service can cascade, causing widespread failures and instability across the entire application. This is known as a cascading failure.

This report identifies a gap in the system's resilience due to the lack of fault tolerance mechanisms in inter-service communication. To mitigate this, we propose the implementation of the **Circuit Breaker** pattern. This pattern will prevent a service from repeatedly attempting to call a failing dependency, allowing the system to handle failures gracefully and giving the struggling service time to recover.

## 2. Analysis of the Gap

Currently, service calls are direct and lack any form of fault tolerance. If a critical service, such as an external email provider, becomes unavailable or experiences high latency, any upstream service attempting to call it will also be blocked or fail. This can lead to:

-   **Resource Exhaustion:** Upstream services may consume all available threads, sockets, or memory while waiting for the failing service to respond.
-   **Poor User Experience:** Users will experience long delays or outright errors, even for operations that are not directly related to the failing component.
-   **Cascading Failures:** The failure of one service can cause a chain reaction, bringing down other dependent services and potentially the entire system.

Without a mechanism to detect and isolate such failures, the system is brittle and not production-ready.

## 3. High-Level Solution

The proposed solution is to implement a generic, reusable Circuit Breaker module. The implementation will follow these steps:

1.  **Create a `CircuitBreaker` Class:** A new module, `src/circuit_breaker.js`, will be created. The class will manage three states:
    *   **CLOSED:** The normal state where requests are passed through to the wrapped service. Failures are tracked.
    *   **OPEN:** After a certain number of failures, the circuit "opens," and subsequent calls fail immediately without attempting to contact the service.
    *   **HALF_OPEN:** After a timeout, the circuit enters a "half-open" state, allowing a single trial request. If it succeeds, the circuit closes; otherwise, it opens again.

2.  **Integrate with a Service:** The `emailService` will be refactored to wrap its external API call with an instance of the `CircuitBreaker`.

3.  **Add Comprehensive Tests:** A new test suite, `tests/circuit_breaker.test.js`, will be created to verify the state transitions and behavior of the Circuit Breaker under various conditions (success, failure, recovery).
