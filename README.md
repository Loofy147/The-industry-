# The Industry: A-Domain-Driven-Design-Exemple

This repository contains a Node.js application that demonstrates advanced software engineering concepts, including:

- **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**: The codebase is organized around business domains, with a clear separation of concerns.
- **CQRS and Event Sourcing**: The application uses the Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) and Event Sourcing (ES) patterns to manage data and state.
- **Microservices Architecture**: The system is designed as a collection of loosely coupled services that communicate via a message bus.
- **Observability**: The application includes a comprehensive observability framework for monitoring and debugging.
- **Automated Testing**: The codebase is covered by a suite of automated tests, ensuring high quality and reliability.

## Getting Started

To get started with the application, you will need to have Node.js and npm installed on your machine.

1. **Clone the repository**:

```
git clone https://github.com/The-Awesome-App/the-industry.git
```

2. **Install the dependencies**:

```
npm install
```

3. **Run the application**:

```
npm start
```

## Architecture

The application is organized into the following directories:

- `src`: Contains the core application logic, including the message bus, event store, and other shared services.
- `systems`: Contains the individual microservices that make up the application.
- `frontend`: Contains the user interface, which is built with React and Redux.
- `tests`: Contains the automated tests for the application.
- `GAP_REPORTS`: Contains reports on identified gaps and areas for improvement.

## API Gateway

The application now includes an API gateway, implemented with Express.js, that provides a single point of entry for all API requests. The API gateway is responsible for routing requests to the appropriate services, as well as for authentication and authorization.

## Monitoring and Management

The application exposes several endpoints for monitoring and runtime management.

### API Endpoints

| Method | Path               | Description                  |
| ------ | ------------------ | ---------------------------- |
| `POST` | `/users`           | Registers a new user.        |
| `DELETE` | `/users/:id`     | Deactivates an existing user.|
| `POST` | `/notifications`   | Sends a test notification.   |
| `GET`  | `/healthz`         | Health check endpoint.       |

### Control API (`/control`)

The Control API provides a set of endpoints for introspecting and managing the system at runtime.

-   `GET /control/config`: Returns the current application configuration.
-   `PATCH /control/config`: Dynamically updates the configuration.
-   `GET /control/circuit-breakers`: Returns the status of all registered circuit breakers.
-   `GET /control/message-bus/dlq`: Returns the contents of the dead letter queue.
-   `GET /control/services`: Returns the discovered system architecture from the service registry.
-   `POST /control/projectors/:name/replay`: Triggers a replay of events for a given projector.

### Distributed Tracing

The application is instrumented with OpenTelemetry for distributed tracing. Traces are exported to the console, allowing you to see the flow of requests as they travel through the system. Each trace is a collection of "spans," which represent individual units of work. By examining the traces, you can identify performance bottlenecks, debug issues across service boundaries, and understand the overall behavior of the system.

### Metrics (`/metrics`)

The application exposes a `/metrics` endpoint that provides real-time performance and health data in the Prometheus exposition format. This data can be scraped by a Prometheus server and used for monitoring, alerting, and dashboarding.

Key metrics include:

-   `http_requests_total`: The total number of HTTP requests, labeled by method, path, and status code.
-   `message_bus_events_published_total`: The total number of events published to the message bus, labeled by topic.
-   `circuit_breaker_state`: The current state of each circuit breaker (0=CLOSED, 1=OPEN, 2=HALF_OPEN), labeled by name.

## Usage

The application can be used to perform a variety of tasks, including:

- **User Registration**: New users can register for an account.
- **User Deactivation**: Existing users can be deactivated.
- **Real-Time Updates**: The frontend is updated in real-time as events are processed on the backend.
