# The Industry: A-Domain-Driven-Design-Exemple

This repository contains a Node.js application that demonstrates advanced software engineering concepts, including:

- **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**: The codebase is organized around business domains, with a clear separation of concerns.
- **CQRS and Event Sourcing**: The application uses the Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) and Event Sourcing (ES) patterns to manage data and state.
- **Microservices Architecture**: The system is designed as a collection of loosely coupled services that communicate via a message bus.
- **Observability**: The application includes a comprehensive observability framework for monitoring and debugging.
- **Automated Testing**: The codebase is covered by a suite of automated tests, ensuring high quality and reliability.

## Getting Started

To get started with the application, you will need to have Node.js and npm installed on your machine.

1. **Clone the repository**:

```
git clone https://github.com/The-Awesome-App/the-industry.git
```

2. **Install the dependencies**:

```
npm install
```

3. **Run the application**:

```
npm start
```

## Architecture

The application is organized into the following directories:

- `src`: Contains the core application logic, including the message bus, event store, and other shared services.
- `systems`: Contains the individual microservices that make up the application.
- `frontend`: Contains the user interface, which is built with React and Redux.
- `tests`: Contains the automated tests for the application.
- `GAP_REPORTS`: Contains reports on identified gaps and areas for improvement.

## Usage

The application can be used to perform a variety of tasks, including:

- **User Registration**: New users can register for an account.
- **User Deactivation**: Existing users can be deactivated.
- **Real-Time Updates**: The frontend is updated in real-time as events are processed on the backend.
